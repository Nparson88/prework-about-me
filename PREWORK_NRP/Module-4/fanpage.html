    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>
      System Of A Down was formed in 1995, in Los Angeles. This was following a meeting of the lead singer Serj Tankian (born on August 21, 1967 in Beirut) with a young guitarist Daron Malakian (born on July 18, 1975 in Glendale), which took place two years earlier.

      Although the men were playing in other bands, but they soon discovered that they had similar interests, so they began together. They were joined by Andranik “Andy” Khatchadurian, who played the drums and together they formed a band named “Soil”. Shortly thereafter, this trio joined Shavarsh “Shavo” Odadjian (born on April 22, 1974 in Yerevan, Armenia). This foursome then came up with another band “System Of A Down” (SOAD). This name was taken from the poem “Victims Of A Down” by Daron Malakiana. The only change in personnel during this period was to replace Khatchaduriana by John Dolmayan (born on July 15, 1973 in Canada).
